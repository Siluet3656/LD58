PURE SOUL

Plot Synopsis: "An Experiment with Souls"

A being from another dimension—a consciousness researcher—has arrived on Earth. Not just a predator, but a scientist studying the phenomenon of the soul: how the energy of thoughts, emotions, and memory shapes the essence of life. Earth attracted him with its abundance of unique souls, each storing a unique spectrum of experience.

The being's motivation is simple and cold: to collect as many souls as possible to complete the experiment. But with each new soul acquired, he begins to observe patterns in human emotions, gradually confronting the concept of individuality and moral dilemmas. In this autobattler world, every victory over an enemy becomes a resource for research—collected souls enhance his abilities and create new strategic options.
